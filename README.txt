"Few days to Live" is a game and an entry to Stop Killing Games(SKG) game jam.

Assets used: please read the AssetsUsed.txt in Assets folder in the project, or you can read the submission page as well.

Transparency: Most of the development of the game is done throughout the SKG game jam period.(Too bad I only got much more free time developing the game in the first two days, other days I have things to busy with even during the night time in my local timezone... But now thanks for the game jam period extension, I can have more time especially on this weekend to design and implement the things I want) There is, however, a partial of the game scripts, scenes and prefabs include health system, bullet spawning, hit/hurtboxes, menu UI are taken from my hobby project which is a private Github repo.

Final Note: Even though if this game is ended up unfinished at all, I hope you can still like/enjoy something from it, whether it is main menu session, gameplay session or other kind of things I didn't thought of. I'll submit the game as an entry to itch.io, eventually on GitHub for SKG game jam as well. I will try to find another platform to upload the game as well if there is any appropriate.
